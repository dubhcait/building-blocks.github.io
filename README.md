# Founders And Coders Application

My one-page portfolio website for my Founders and Coders application. Includes:

HTML, CSS and Javascript - no frameworks or libraries used
Links to my Github repo, FreeCodeCamp and Codewars profiles, and Twitter 

A link to my responsive image carousel hosted on Codepen, and links to the standalone Github Page

Links to external webpages that are relevant to my application


This page is live at :
https://dubhcait.github.io/building-blocks.github.io/

This was first even attempt at building a website. 

Challenges:

- Optimisation for mobiles - initially designed with a laptop screen in mind. 

-Difficulty with media queries and lack of time meant it wasn't as responsive as I would have liked.
